# Homework 1 - No One JSON 

## Summary

In this assignment, we are simulating a robotic vehicle on Mars that is investigating five meteorite landing sites that are located in Syrtis Major, which is a quadrangle region on Mars. This assignment directory contains two python scripts: one that sets up the simulation by generating five random landing site locations and assigning meteorite compositions to each and another script that calculates the time it takes for the vehicle to visit and take samples from each site. This simulation is important as it can give an approximation for the amount of time and distance that the vehicle needs to travel and work.

## Part 1

`generate_sites.py` 

## Part 2

Write a function that determines the length of a given name based on the number of characters, excluding spaces. Using the `names` module, print 5 full names along the length of each name with the help of the new function.
